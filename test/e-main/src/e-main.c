/*

The purpose of the program is to demonstrate simple parallel programming
example for the Parallella demonstrating how to do fork-join
parallel processing using the Epiphany library. Similar type programs can be
constructed with OpenCL, OpenMP, and many other parallel programming frameworks.


The main.c program distributes N tasks to N Epiphany cores in parallel and
aggregates the result after all cores have completed to produce the final
result.
